## Exercise 2
- Create a class diagram (on paper or any other tool) for the relation among the following entities:

  - There is a Driver that owns a DriversLicense. The DriversLicense cannot exist without a Driver.
  - The Driver owns a Car. The Car exists even without a Driver.
- Use the correct UML connectors for the above relations among the entities
- Create the skeleton source code for the above classes (no need for fields, constructors or methods) and compile it
