### Exercise5 - tic tac toe
**Implement a tic tac toe (triliza) game which is played by two players.**
- You may use one or two dimention array to store the results (the 'X' and 'O').
- You can use a while loop to give turns for the 'X' or the 'O' player.
- Create a *drawFunction* that can take as an argument the array and print the current tic tac toe's status before each players turn.
- Create *function that can check* rows, columns, and diagonals, which is performed after a player played his symbol, 'X' or 'O', and prints win if there is a winner, otherwise the game still goes on if and if there is available position in the array. - If a player placed his symbol in an occupied position print an error message and let him play again.
